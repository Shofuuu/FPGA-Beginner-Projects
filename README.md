# FPGA Beginner Projects

Welcome to **FPGA Beginner Projects**, a growing collection of beginner-friendly Verilog and FPGA designs. This repository is meant to help new learners understand the basics of digital logic, simulation, and hardware implementation using real, practical examples.

This collection is **still growing** — more projects will be added over time. Stay tuned and thank you for your patience!
